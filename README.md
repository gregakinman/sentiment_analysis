This is the code for Greg Kinman's sentiment analysis project at Freescale.
===

There are three "phases" in the project pipeline:
---

- Phase 1: scraping the web for text data.
- Phase 2: labeling the data with sentiment.
- Phase 3: analyzing the labeled data for patterns and EBI insight.

The subdirectories are titled accordingly.
